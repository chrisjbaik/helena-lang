# helena-lang

The code for the Helena library, including the Chrome extension.

## Quickstart

1. Run `npm install` to install all development dependencies.
2. Run `npx webpack` to generate the `dist` directory and place the compiled
   code into it.

## Miscellaneous

As of April 2020, recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
for development, as it does a lot of Typescript compiler checking by default and
is super convenient to use.

## TODO

- Not sure what exactly should be exported from this library, might need to be
  lower level than current setup.
- Restructuring classes/interfaces in a clearer way.
- Better documentation for classes/functions.
